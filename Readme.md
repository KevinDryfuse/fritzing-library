Kevin's Fritzing-library
========================

This is just a [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)library of the parts I've needed for my work, but I couldn't find anywhere else.

If you would like to just use the parts then just download fritzing_library.fzbz and import the parts bin 
into Fritzing (File -> Parts Bin -> Open -> From File...)
